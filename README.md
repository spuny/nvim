# Config

My nvim config that im using daily. I switched from SpaceVim cause there was not
enough flexibility. So I'm back from VScode/SpaceVim to maintaining my vim/nvim config.

## Plugins

Not all the plugins and configs are mine. I would love to give most of the credit
to The Primeagen (https://github.com/ThePrimeagen) and his videos.

Btw I made some modifications so it is not the same. I'm using this on MacOS.
Specifically M1 silicone macbook pro. But it should work with linux without any problems.

## Dependencies

Please install rg (ripgrep) binary if you haven't done so, otherwise telescope
will not display grep results.

Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
apt-get install ripgrep
```
MacOS:
```bash
brew install rg
brew install fd
```

### Credits

Again many thanks to ThePrimeagen and his videos. I realized i need more flexibility.
Yes credits and thanks in git readme, deal with it.
